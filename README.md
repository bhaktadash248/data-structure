**Data structure Big O notation**
1.	Describe what is Big O notation.
2.	Time complexity and space complexity.
3.	Evaluate the time complexity and space complexity of different algorithms using Big O notation

**Sliding window**

this pattern involves creating a window which can eaither be an array or number from one position to another

Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes( and a new window created)

Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc.


**Divide and conquer**

This pattern invloves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process with a subset of data.

This pattern can termendously decrese time complexity

*****

1. Write a anagram programme using javascript
2. Write a function which accepts a sorted arrat of intigers. The function should find the first pair where the sum is zero. Return an array that includesboth values that sum to zero or undefined if a pair does not exists
3. Implement a function called count unique values which accepts a sorted array and count the unique values in that array. there can be -ve numbers in that array but it will be always sorted
4. write a function called max subarray sum which accepts an array of intigers and a number called navigator. the function should calculate the maximum sum of n consecutive element in the array
