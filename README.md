**Data structure Big O notation**
1.	Describe what is Big O notation.
2.	Time complexity and space complexity.
3.	Evaluate the time complexity and space complexity of different algorithms using Big O notation

**Sliding window**

this pattern involves creating a window which can eaither be an array or number from one position to another

Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes( and a new window created)

Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc.


**Divide and conquer**

This pattern invloves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process with a subset of data.

This pattern can termendously decrese time complexity

**recursive function**

A recursive function is a function that calls itself somewhere within the body of the function. 

In recursive a base case(the condition when the recursion ends) is required or else we ll get an maximum callstack size exceeded error. i.e. stack overflow.

*****

1. Write a anagram programme using javascript
2. Write a function which accepts a sorted arrat of intigers. The function should find the first pair where the sum is zero. Return an array that includesboth values that sum to zero or undefined if a pair does not exists
3. Implement a function called count unique values which accepts a sorted array and count the unique values in that array. there can be -ve numbers in that array but it will be always sorted
4. write a function called max subarray sum which accepts an array of intigers and a number called navigator. the function should calculate the maximum sum of n consecutive element in the array
5. Given a sorted array of integers, write a function called search, that accepts a value and returns the index where the value 
passed to the function is located. 
If the value is not found, return -1
6. write factorial of a number using recusively
