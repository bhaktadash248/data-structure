**Data structure Big O notation**
1.	Describe what is Big O notation.
2.	Time complexity and space complexity.
3.	Evaluate the time complexity and space complexity of different algorithms using Big O notation

**Logical programe**

1. Write a anagram programme using javascript
2. Write a function which accepts a sorted arrat of intigers. The function should find the first pair where the sum is zero. Return an array that includesboth values that sum to zero or undefined if a pair does not exists
3. Implement a function called count unique values which accepts a sorted array and count the unique values in that array. there can be -ve numbers in that array but it will be always sorted
